purpose of building this repository is to understand the concepts of database, and to practice the skills of using\ndatabase. There are some goals wanted to achieve in this repository, with handling databases in several programming\nlanguages being the major one.\nTo develop a large project, we may use multiple databases to process and store\ninformation. These database are run by different programming languages. Observing queries and operations of databases\nhave similar syntax and features. We can group the syntax and features into a set of common functions. For example, a\nSQL database must have commands to store, insert, update, and delete data. The common functions help us to understand\nand use databases quickly.\nCatalog\nMongoDB\nPostgreDB\nMySQL\n"},"1. MongoDB/":{"url":"1. MongoDB/","title":"1. MongoDB","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nMongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented database system. It is designed to store and\nmanage unstructured data\nin the form of documents, which are similar to JSON objects. MongoDB is known for its flexible data model, horizontal\nscalability, and ease of use.\nMongoDB VS SQL Database\nAdvantages of MongoDB\n\nData Model: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored in a more flexible and dynamic\nway\ncompared to traditional SQL databases, which are based on a rigid table structure. In MongoDB, data is stored in\ncollections of documents, which are similar to JSON objects and can have varying structures. In contrast, SQL\ndatabases\nuse tables with a fixed schema, where each row has the same set of columns.\nQuery Language: MongoDB uses a query language called MongoDB Query Language (MQL), which is based on JSON and\nallows\nfor more flexible and expressive queries. SQL databases, on the other hand, use SQL (Structured Query Language),\nwhich is more rigid and requires a predefined schema.\nScalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which means that it can easily handle large datasets by\ndistributing them across multiple servers. Traditional SQL databases, on the other hand, are designed to scale\nvertically, which means that they rely on adding more resources to a single server.\nPerformance: MongoDB can provide faster performance for certain types of queries, especially when dealing\nwith large\ndatasets. This is because it can use indexing and other optimization techniques to speed up queries. In contrast,\ntraditional SQL databases may experience performance issues when dealing with complex queries or large datasets.\n\nDisadvantages of MongoDB\n\nTransactions: MongoDB supports transactions, but with some limitations. Traditional SQL databases, on the other hand,\nhave strong support for transactions and provide advanced features suchas ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,\nand Durability) compliance, which ensures that transactions are executed reliably and with data integrity.\nData Relationships: MongoDB supports data relationships between documents using a feature called document embedding\nor referencing. This allows for more flexible and efficient data modeling compared to traditional SQL databases,\nwhich use foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.\n\nConclusion\nIn my points of view, MongoDB is a good choice for big data analysis and data mining due to its flexibility and easy\nmigration. However, it is not a good choice for transactional data due to its lack of ACID compliance. e.g. databse of\nSalvio Environmental Monitor.\nACID Compliance\n\nAtomicity: This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. It means that\neither all the operations in a transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are completed at all. If any\npart\nof a transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to its original state.\n\nConsistency: This property ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. It means\nthat\na transaction should not violate any integrity constraints or business rules defined by the database schema. If a\ntransaction violates any constraints or rules, it is rolled back to its original state.\n\nIsolation: This property ensures that multiple transactions can execute concurrently without interfering with each\nother. It means that each transaction should be executed in isolation from other transactions, and the results of a\ntransaction should not be visible to other transactions until it is committed.\n\nDurability: This property ensures that the results of a transaction are permanent and survive system failures. It\nmeans\nthat once a transaction is committed, its changes are saved to non-volatile storage, such as a hard disk or SSD, and\nwill still be available even if the system crashes.\n\n\n"},"1.
