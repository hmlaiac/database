# Introduction

The purpose of building this repository is to understand the concepts of database, and to practice the skills of using
database. There are some goals wanted to achieve in this repository, with handling databases in several programming
languages being the major one.

To develop a large project, we may use multiple databases to process and store
information. These database are run by different programming languages. Observing queries and operations of databases
have similar syntax and features. We can group the syntax and features into a set of common functions. For example, a
SQL database must have commands to store, insert, update, and delete data. The common functions help us to understand
and use databases quickly.
